bibliography: Tex/ref.bib       # Do not edit: Keep this naming convention and location.
csl: Tex/harvard-stellenbosch-university.csl # referencing format used.
# By default, the bibliography only displays the cited references. If you want to change this, you can comment out one of the following:
#nocite: '@*' # Add all items in bibliography, whether cited or not
# nocite: |  # add specific references that aren't cited
#  @grinold2000

toc: FALSE                       # Add a table of contents
numbersections: TRUE             # Should sections (and thus figures and tables) be numbered?
fontsize: 11pt                  # Set fontsize
linestretch: 1.2                # Set distance between lines.
link-citations: TRUE            # This creates dynamic links to the papers in reference list.

### Adding additional latex packages:
# header-includes:
#    - \usepackage{colortbl} # Add additional packages here.

output:
  pdf_document:

    fig_height: 3.5
abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

Load data, transform to xts format, and combine in one dataset for easier work


```{r}
pacman::p_load("xts", "tbl2xts", "PerformanceAnalytics", "RcppRoll")

AI_xts <- AI_Funds %>% tbl_xts()
ASISA_xts <- ASISA %>% select(-Index, -FoF) %>% spread(Fund, Returns) %>% tbl_xts() 

ASISA_mean <- mean_A(ASISA) 

BM_xts <- BM %>% select(-Tickers) %>% tbl_xts()

merged <- merge.xts(AI_xts, ASISA_mean, BM_xts) %>% na.omit() 
colnames(merged) <- c("AI_Fund", "Managed_Funds", "Benchmark")

```

Combined data frame allows to plot the cumulative returns of Managed funds, the AI fund 
and the benchmark fund to compare the cumulative performance

```{r}
chart.CumReturns(merged, legend.loc = 1)
```

After calculating cumulative returns to assess overall performance, rolling returns are analyzed to evaluate consistency and resilience over different time periods, addressing potential biases from early outcomes or isolated events. 
Again, I will use the PerformanceAnalytics package, to calculate 3 year rolling returns.

```{r}
chart.RollingPerformance(merged, 36, legend.loc = 3)
```



```{r}
density_plot(merged, 36)
```
Lets look at the risk and the volatility of the different funds, start of with the
rolling standard deviation

```{r}
density_plot_var(merged, 36)
```

Rolling plot already shows lowest variance for Managed funds, and highest variance for AI fund
Lets look at the downside deviation which measures the risk of an investment by calculating the standard deviation of negative returns below a defined threshold.

```{r}
DownsideDeviation(merged, 0)
chart.Drawdown(merged, legend.loc = 3)
```

We can see that the AI funds downside deviation is more thandouble as high as the Managed funds,
and slightly higher than benchmark. Lets visualize.

```{r}
chart.Drawdown(merged, legend.loc = 3)
```
