# Introduction {-}

This template has been adapted from pagedown::html_paged and is intended to help you simply create HTML that has a readable (pdf) feel to it.

References are to be made as follows: [@fama1997] and @grinold2000 Such authors could also be referenced in brackets [@grinold2000] and together [@fama1997 \& @grinold2000]. Source the reference code from scholar.google.com by clicking on ``cite'' below article name. Then select BibTeX at the bottom of the Cite window, and proceed to copy and paste this code into your ref.bib file, located in the directory's Tex folder. Open this file in Rstudio for ease of management, else open it in your preferred Tex environment. Add and manage your article details here for simplicity - once saved, it will self-adjust in your paper.

> I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code. Also, be mindful of the fact that bib references from google scholar may at times be incorrect. Reference Latex forums for correct bibtex notation.

Writing in Rmarkdown is surprizingly easy - see [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) cheatsheet for a summary on writing Rmd writing tips.

# Data  {-}

Notice how I used the curly brackets and dash to remove the numbering of the data section.

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure.

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data in a data folder.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r }

MAA <- read_rds("/Users/x/Downloads/28736907_Fin_Metrics/Questions/Question6/data/MAA.rds")
msci <- read_rds("/Users/x/Downloads/28736907_Fin_Metrics/Questions/Question6/data/msci.rds") %>%
filter(Name %in% c("MSCI_ACWI", "MSCI_USA", "MSCI_RE", "MSCI_Jap"))

```



```{r}
library(rmsfuns)
dates5 <- dateconverter(as.Date("2011-01-01"), as.Date("2023-01-01"),
    "weekdayEOM") %>% data.frame() %>% set_names(., "date")
eom_msci <- merge(dates5, msci, by = "date")
eom_MAA <- merge(dates5, MAA, by ="date")
eom_MAA <- eom_MAA %>%
  mutate(
    Description = case_when(
      startsWith(Ticker, "L") ~ "Rates",
      startsWith(Ticker, "A") ~ "Currency",
      startsWith(Ticker, "D") ~ "Currency",
      startsWith(Ticker, "B") ~ "Commodity",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) %>% select(-Ticker)
eom_msci <- eom_msci %>% mutate(Description = "Equity")

merged <- rbind(eom_msci, eom_MAA)

#ret_msci <- eom_msci %>% group_by(Name) %>% mutate(log(Price) - lag(log(Price))) %>% 
    

```

2. Data Preparation
```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, tbl2xts, quadprog)
price_xts <- tbl_xts(merged, cols_to_xts = "Price", spread_by = "Name")

```

3. Filter Assets with at Least 3 Years of Data

```{r}
valid_assets <- colnames(price_xts)[colSums(!is.na(price_xts)) >= 36]
price_xts <- price_xts[, valid_assets]


```

4. Calculate Monthly Returns

```{r}
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
returns_xts <- na.omit(Return.calculate(price_xts, method = "log"))
```

5. Rolling Window for Covariance and Mean Forecasts

```{r}
lookback_period <- 24  # months

# Function to calculate rolling covariance and mean
library(zoo)
rolling_cov <- rollapply(returns_xts, width = lookback_period, FUN = cov, by.column = FALSE, align = "right")
rolling_mean <- rollapply(returns_xts, width = lookback_period, FUN = colMeans, by.column = FALSE, align = "right")

```

6. Asset Classification

```{r}
# Assume you have a data frame mapping assets to their classes
# asset_classes <- data.frame(
#   Asset = asset_names,
#   Class = c("Equity", "Bond", "Credit", ...)
# )

# Merge with returns data
asset_classes <- merged %>% select(Name, Description) %>% distinct()
# Add a 'Class' column based on Description or other criteria
# For example:
asset_classes <- asset_classes %>%
  mutate(Class = case_when(
    str_detect(Description, "Equity") ~ "Equity",
    str_detect(Description, "Rates") ~ "Rates",
    TRUE ~ "Rates"
  ))

```

8. Quarterly Rebalancing

```{r}
Rebalance_Days <- merged %>%
    mutate(Year = format(date, "%Y"), Month = format(date, "%b"),
        Day = format(date, "%a")) %>%
    filter(Month %in% c("Jan", "Apr", "Jul", "Oct")) %>%
    select(date, Year, Month, Day) %>%
    unique() %>%
    group_by(Month) %>%
    group_by(Year, Month) %>%
    filter(date == first(date)) %>%
    pull(date)
```

9. Portfolio Optimization

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(quadprog)
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)
library(Matrix)

# Function to compute optimal weights at each rebalancing date
compute_optimal_weights <- function(date, returns_xts, lookback_period, asset_classes) {
      
      # Get the end date (current rebalancing date)
      end_date <- date
      
      # Get the start date (lookback_period months before the end date)
      index_dates <- index(returns_xts)[index(returns_xts) <= end_date]
      start_index <- length(index_dates) - (lookback_period - 1)
      if (start_index < 1) {
        stop("Not enough data for the lookback period.")
      }
      start_date <- index_dates[start_index]
      
      # Subset the returns data for the lookback period
      returns_sub <- returns_xts[paste(start_date, end_date, sep = "/"), ]
      
      # Remove assets with NA values
      returns_sub <- returns_sub[, colSums(is.na(returns_sub)) == 0]
      
      # Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix
      mu <- colMeans(returns_sub)
      sigma <- cov(returns_sub)
      
      # Check if covariance matrix is positive definite
      eigen_values <- eigen(sigma)$values
      if (any(eigen_values <= 0)) {
        # Make sigma positive definite
        sigma <- as.matrix(nearPD(sigma)$mat)
      }
      
      # Update Dmat
      Dmat <- 2 * sigma
      
      # Assets to include (non-NA data)
      valid_assets <- colnames(returns_sub)
      
      # Map assets to classes
      asset_classes_sub <- asset_classes %>% filter(Name %in% valid_assets)

      bvec <- c(beq, b_ge0, b_le40, b_equity, b_bond)
      
      meq <- 1  # Number of equality constraints
      
      # Now solve the quadratic programming problem
      result <- solve.QP(Dmat, dvec, Amat, bvec, meq = meq)
      
      weights <- result$solution
      
      # Return weights as a named vector
      weights <- setNames(weights, valid_assets)
      
      return(weights)
    }

# Apply the function to each rebalancing date

Rebalance days
```{r}

    # Now we have to distinguish rebalances - to create
    # something to group by:
mutate(RebalanceTime = format(date, "%Y%B")) %>%
    # Now we can group...
group_by(RebalanceTime) %>%
    # Now trim down to 30 stocks and reweight so sum(w)=1

#  Methodology \label{Meth} {-}

## Subsection {-}
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]

## Math section {-}

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align}
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use $ symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

$$
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
$$

Writing nice math requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the equations. I can also align equations using  __\&__, and set to numbering only the first line. Now I will have to type ``begin equation'' which is a native \LaTeX command. Here follows a more complicated equation:


\begin{align}
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Note that above we've aligned the equations by the equal signs. I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads''.

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples provided.

## Results {-}

Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).

```{r table-1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

data <- mtcars[1:5,] %>% tibble::as_tibble()

table <- kable(data, row.names = TRUE,
      caption = 'Table with kable() and kablestyling()',
      format = "html", booktabs = T) %>%
        kable_styling(full_width = T,
                      latex_options = c("striped",
                                        "scale_down",
                                        "HOLD_position"),
                      font_size = 13)
table
```

To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \@ref(tab:table-1) we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`. Notice the use of table-2 in the chunk name. That's the good stuff.

# Model summary


Check [this](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html) link out for more. Note this package also plays nicely with gt, kableExtra, etc.

```{r}

library(modelsummary);library(gt)

# modelsummary works well with gt:

Tab <-

datasummary_skim(swiss,
type="numeric",
 histogram=T,
 title = "Summary: Numeric variables", output = "gt") %>%

        # column labels
    tab_spanner(label = 'Statistics', columns = c("Mean", "SD")) %>%
    tab_spanner(label = 'Quantiles', columns = starts_with("P")) %>%
    # footnote
    tab_footnote(footnote = md("A very **important** Footnote."),
                 locations = cells_body(rows = 3, columns = 1)) %>%

    tab_options(data_row.padding = px(4),table.width = pct(60),
            column_labels.font.size = pct(100),
            column_labels.vlines.width = 1, table.font.size = pct(60))

Tab
